# About Me

My passion for cybersecurity started when I first did my Master's thesis on human security, which made me realize that cybersecurity is one of the unexplored subjects in the traditional context of human security. Then, my passion was further expanded when I first joined a CTF (Capture The Flag) workshop for beginners in November 2023, and my discovery of OSINT and steganography amazed me. At the end of the event, there was also a mini-CTF challenge for the participants, and I managed to solve my first CTF challenges, which still made me excited. Ever since then, I pushed myself to continue learning.

Coming from Non-IT background, I am now eager to transition to this field when later I found that Cyber Threat Intelligence has both elements of my passion in cybersecurity and my background in Political Science.
